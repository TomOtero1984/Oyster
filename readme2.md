Absolutely. Here’s your README.md for the Oyster project:

# 🐚 Oyster

**Oyster** is a Rust-powered, symbolic shell and language runtime — inspired by Smalltalk, Lisp, and Unix, reimagined for modern, live systems.

> 🔥 A shell that lives.  
> 🔧 A language that evolves.  
> 🧠 A runtime that rewrites itself.

---

## 🌟 What is Oyster?

Oyster is:

- 🐚 A clean, expressive **terminal shell** with native commands like `ls`, `mv`, and `liberate`
- 🔣 A live, symbolic **language** with user-defined functions, macros, and operators
- 🌀 A dynamic, **extensible runtime** that can be modified at runtime and extended with Rust plugins
- 🦀 Written entirely in **Rust**, with zero dependence on libc or the GNU toolchain

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **REPL** with symbolic, structured commands
- **Live function & macro definitions**
- **Custom operator grammar**
- **Hot-loaded Rust modules** (via `.so`/`.dylib` or `.wasm`)
- **Optional JIT / bytecode backend**
- **Zero reliance on C or POSIX tools**

---

## 📦 Example Usage

```oyster
liberate "fs"

ls -l ./src | grep ".rs"

def greet(name) = say "Hello, $name"

unless file.exists("log.txt") {
    touch log.txt
}

🛠 Architecture Overview

Core Components
	•	Lexer / Parser — User-extensible grammar engine
	•	Evaluator — Interprets AST directly (JIT planned)
	•	Symbol Table — Tracks variables, functions, macros
	•	Module Loader — Loads .so/.wasm crates at runtime
	•	REPL Shell — Live command prompt + scripting layer

Rust Module Interface

#[oyster_module]
pub fn math_module() -> OysterModule {
    let mut m = OysterModule::new("math");
    m.add_fn("add", |args| { ... });
    m
}


⸻

🔌 Plugin System
	•	Written in Rust
	•	Dynamically loadable via libloading, abi_stable, or WASM
	•	Uses structured trait interfaces like OysterModule
	•	Future support for napcn — a native package manager for Oyster modules

⸻

🧠 Philosophy

Inspiration	What We Borrow
Smalltalk	Live runtime, self-editing
Lisp	Macros + meta-programming
Unix Shell	Tool composability
Rust	Safety and performance
Lua	Minimal, embeddable runtime


⸻

🚀 Roadmap
	•	✅ Interactive REPL + parser
	•	✅ Core functions (def, say, liberate)
	•	✅ Function and operator redefinition
	•	🔄 Runtime macro and syntax extension
	•	🧩 Dynamic Rust module loading
	•	🔥 Bytecode engine + optional JIT
	•	📦 Package manager: napcn
	•	🧪 Unit tests and CLI harness
	•	📘 Official module registry

🪞 Why “Oyster”?

Like its namesake:
	•	Small, efficient, and self-contained
	•	Closed by default, but open to those who pry
	•	And inside is a pearl: the language, the runtime, the power

🧑‍💻 Contributing

Oyster is designed to be forkable, hackable, and live.
	•	You can define your own syntax
	•	You can build Rust-native modules
	•	You can redefine Oyster itself while it’s running

Join the revolution in symbolic shell computing.
