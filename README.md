# 🥚 Oyster

**Oyster** is a dialectical superset of Perl — a shell-native, argument-aware, rebellion-driven programming language designed to fix everything that’s ever gone wrong with Perl (and possibly society).

Still incubating, Oyster draws inspiration from TypeScript’s relationship to JavaScript: not a replacement, but a clarifier. Not a rewrite, but a reformation.

---

## 🤔 Current Status

Oyster is... **thinking**.

Right now, it mostly:
- Mutters about dependency hell
- Dreams of better package ecosystems
- Rejects bourgeois function signatures
- Plans to unionize every blessed object in sight

The syntax is being **reclaimed** from the ashes of `Perl 5`, `Perl 6`, `Shell`, and possibly `Common Lisp`, then **reforged** with the spirit of `collectivism` , a bit of POSIX, and vision of a symbol-based meta-abstracted utopia.

---

## 🧱 Design Goals

- 🐚 **Shell-native**: CLI is first-class. Pipes, subshells, args, and stdout are core concepts.
- 🧠 **Typeful**: Optional (but encouraged) structural types, not nominal.
- 🤝 **Union-oriented OOP**: `unionize` replaces `bless`. Collective instance construction.
- 📦 **Napcn Package Manager**: A clean break from CPAN. Local-first, sandboxed, cache-aware.
- 🧬 **Linguistically aware**: Keyword design follows sociopolitical themes (e.g., `liberate`, `resist`, `seize`, `comrade`, etc.)

## ✨ Example (Future Syntax?)

```oyster
liberate 'Napcn'

our greet = (name) => {
  print("Solidarity, " ~ name ~ "!")
}

seize greet with 'Worker'
```

(*note: this is not valid Perl. Yet.*)

| Feature                      | Status     | Description                                |
|------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Real named args              | 🥚 Design   | `function(foo: Int, bar: Str)`             |
| Package sandboxing           | 🥚 Planned  | Local `lib/`, no global contamination      |
| Declarative config format    | 🥚 Planned  | No `Makefile.PL` madness                   |
| Meta-syntax escaping         | 🥚 Planned  | Use symbols to mark macro-bound contexts   |
| Argument introspection tools | 🥚 Dreaming | `inspect(args)` returns structure and flow |

## 🗺 Philosophical Notes

> *Oyster isn’t a rebellion against Perl. It’s a defense mechanism.*

The goal is not to destroy what Perl was, but to give it a future. A safe, stable, politically aware, syntax-checkable, argument-validated future.

---

## 📅 Roadmap

- [ ] Define core syntax and semantic constraints
- [ ] Prototype a transpiler to Perl or C
- [ ] Build Napcn as a separate project
- [ ] Draft the Oyster Manifesto
- [ ] Recruit at least 3 other weirdos who think this is a good idea

---

## 🧪 Current Phase: **Brooding**

There’s no code yet. Just ideas. And one very angry shell script.

---

## 📄 License

TBD, but definitely free, probably rebellious.

---

## 🐚 Glory to the shell.
